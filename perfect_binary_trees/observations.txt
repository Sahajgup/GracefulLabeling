1. (claim) Roots have even labels. Checked Programmatically for trees upto height 3 (#nodes = 15)

Approach Tried : 

1st method

m = #edges
m is even of complete binary trees.

After assining an odd edge to root, 
#even labels node left = m / 2 + 1
#odd labels node left = m / 2 - 1

Try to reason that using the above number of even and odd node labels,
#even edge labels != #odd edge labels != m / 2

Try to use combinatorics, 
Number of even edges => odd node -- odd node edge + even node -- even node edge = m / 2 
Number of odd edges => odd node -- even node edge = m / 2 
If root is odd then this sort of configuration is not possible to obtain ?? 


2nd method

Assign each node a value depending on the difference between #even nodes and #odd nodes in its subtree (balancing factor). 
Try to show that there will some problem in assining labeling if the root is odd using these balancing factors.
