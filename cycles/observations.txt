Already known results for cycles : 
1. The cycle graph Cn is graceful if, and only if, n ≡ 0, 3 (mod 4).

Observations : 

For cycle C6, there was no solution when using node labels from {0, 1, 2, ...., 18} for 1st version (a) of the relaxation problem. 

To find solution of graceful problem, it is enough to check value k upto ≈ m^2 / 4
